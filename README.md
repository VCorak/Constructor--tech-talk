# Constructor--tech-talk

https://vcorak.github.io/Constructor--tech-talk/

This was my first live coding talk, it was frightening and I went out of my comfort zone, but eveything went fine, hands were shaking and but I succedeed to move my player with the mouse, so it is a win for me haha ;).

I have got a lot of god advices and feedbacks. Thank you for that guys, will improve for next time for sure.

#GOAL

Goal of this presentation was to introduce one method of making games which I very much like- constructor, making objects, declaring classes and it is called object oriented programming (thank you Sicco :D) and will for sure try to learn more about it. What I hope the most is, that this presentation and repo can help somebody who wants to learn more and start to discover constructor and making games.

#RESOURCES

I really loved and enjoyed online youtube tutorial called Frank's laboratory and I learned a lot. It is really fun channel with making simple arcade 2d games.
